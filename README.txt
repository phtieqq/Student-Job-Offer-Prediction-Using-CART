This project builds a Decision Tree Classifier (CART algorithm using Gini impurity) to predict whether a candidate will receive a job offer based on their CGPA, interactivity, practical knowledge, and communication skills.

The dataset is stored in GPA.csv, and the code uses pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn for data processing, model training, and visualization.
